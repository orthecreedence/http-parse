   the http object passed in, a boolean representing whether the headers have
   been fully parsed, and a boolean representing whether the request/response
   is finished (blank body, all body bytes accounted for, or 0-length chunk
   received).
   
   During the parsing, the closure will call (if specified) the `header-callback`
   with all the headers as a plist once they are fully parsed, and the
   `body-callback` with the body once either it finishes parsing (if we have
   Content-Length) or once for each set of completed chunks sent, which allows
   streaming the body as it comes in. If a multipart callback is given, it will
   be called at least once for each form field present in the multipart form
   data.

   The `:finish-callback` will be called when the HTTP payload is fully
   processed.
   
   The :store-body keyword indicates to the parser that we wish to keep the
   body (in its entirety) in the http object passed in (accessible via the
   http-body accessor). Otherwise, the body will be discarded as it's parsed
   (but remember, will still be sent to the body-callback as it comes in).
